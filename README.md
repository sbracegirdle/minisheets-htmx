# Minisheets (htmx edition)

A small spreadsheet app built with [htmx](https://htmx.org/) for the frontend and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) for the backend.

This is a technology demo, not a production-ready app. It's not secure, it's not scalable, and it's not even useful. It's a fun way to compare the DX of htmx to React and other SPA friends.
